# Reflection #1

Pod Members: **Sophia, Jovan, Ayslin**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Connected frontend to backend

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Working with prisma and nextui

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Not quite, we will first prioritize the tasks that were due this week and then move onto the backlog for sprint 2.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes the instructors were particularly helpful

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Budget history (it might be up for removal)
