# Reflection #3

Pod Members: **Sophia, Jovan, A**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We finished our mvp

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 No issues really, just time management

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes we finished the tasks for our sprint

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 We got some good guidance from Alex as well as some of our peers in cohort 2

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Some validation in the backend for user inputs, we don't really have the time to fix that now unfortunately, but being aware of it is good at least.
